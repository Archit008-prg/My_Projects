Medical Insurance Price Predictor

This project involves building a predictive model to estimate medical insurance charges based on individual demographics and health-related information. Using machine learning techniques, analysis and insurance prices predictionhas been done, helping to understand how various factors influence insurance costs.

Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Preprocessing

1. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key features affecting insurance costs.
2. Built and evaluated a predictive model to estimate insurance charges using linear regression.
3. Identified the most significant factors impacting insurance prices.
4. Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (one-hot Encoding), and scaling numerical features.
5. Using linear regression as the primary model to predict insurance charges.
6. Evaluating model performance with metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score.

Tools and libraries

1. Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and preprocessing.
2. Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
3. Scikit-Learn for machine learning model building and evaluation.


Future Work

1. Testing more advanced machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to improve prediction accuracy.
2. Exploring more of feature engineering to capture additional relationships.
3. Deploying the model on cloud platforms for scalable access.
