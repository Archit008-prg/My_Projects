Exploratory Analysis of Australian Weather Dataset

This is a project that involves a exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Australian weather dataset. The analysis provides insights into weather patterns and trends that may influence weather conditions across Australia. Themain aim of this project is to understand the distribution, relationships, and seasonality of various weather parameters and serves as a basis for further predictive modeling

The objectives of this analysis are to:

1.Gain insights into the distribution and variability of weather attributes.
2.Examine correlations between weather features.
3.Identify patterns and trends in weather data, particularly regarding rainfall.
4.Prepare the data for potential predictive modeling tasks.

Tools and Libraries

Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: Numerical computations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization.


Future work

1. Cleaning the data
2. Advancement in pre-processed data
3. Making the predictive model
